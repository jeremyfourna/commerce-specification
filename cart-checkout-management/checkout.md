# Checkout

A **checkout** allows a [sales-order] to be created. To do that, a [customer] must define several information.

* The [cart] that should be transformed as a [sales-order]
* The billing address
* The payment method
* Optional: the delivery address (if the [customer] would like to buy virtual products)
