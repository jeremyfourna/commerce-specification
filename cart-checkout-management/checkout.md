# Checkout
A **checkout** allows a [[sales-order]] to be created. To do that, a [[customer]] must define several information.

* The [[cart]] that should be transformed as a [[sales-order]].
* The billing address
* The payment method
* Optional: the delivery address (if the [[customer]] would like to buy virtual products)
